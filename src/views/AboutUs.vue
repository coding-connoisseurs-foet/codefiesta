      <p>
        Code Fiesta is a three-day, multi-faceted technical event which consists
        of a wide range of contests related to coding, developing, creativity
        and a lot more! The event was first held in May 2022 with the sole
        purpose of providing the students with a platform to display their
        technical prowess and to enhance their problem solving skills and
        critical thinking. This technical fest comprises a variety of
        competitions starting from competitive coding to capture the flag to
        meme-making, and a lot more!
      </p>
      <p>
        Each competition has its own score and a collective leaderboard will be
        maintained to decide the final winners.
      </p>
      <p>There will be both individual as well as team events.</p>
